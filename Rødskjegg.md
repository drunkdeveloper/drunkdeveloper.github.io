Messed up the OG reading, only have preboil SG and FG. Need to figure out how to calculate the OG from the SG Preboil volume(29L) and boil off.

## The numbers

| Variable | Goal   | Achieved      | Comment
|---       |---     |---            |---
| OG       | 1.071  | 1075          | Calculated OG here, was 1069 preboil
| FG       | 1.013  | 1023          | Not done yet, still hisses when I open the lid so it might be fermenting yet.
| EBC      | 8.9    | ?             |
| ABV(%)   | 7.6    | 6.83          | As of 19.02.2019
