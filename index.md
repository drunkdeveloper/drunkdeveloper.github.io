## Comments
Very easy and comfortable brew. It feels like the mashing and sparging is more like it's supposed to be when you are dealing with 5 kilos grain as opposed to 8 kilograms. It's less overflow during mashing, and no stuck sparge.

Think I got the temperature about right in the fermentation vessel and I used both packs of yeast. And I rehydrated the yeast. Finished the brew just before midnight and placed it on top of my freezer since it should start off at 25 &deg;. When I woke up today 14 hours later, the temperature was 28&deg;. And the airlock was bubbling a lot. Tried to get the temperature down during the day, and now it sits below 27&deg;. I'll try to lower the temperature gradually.

I ended up with around 22.8 liters in the fermentation vessel with an slightly above the target.
