## TODO

****Mental note**** #1: easybrew should have an easy way to record the above for several beers currently in the loop.
****Mental note**** #2: would be nice to be able to see grainfather display on the computer.
****Mental note**** #3: statistics over sensor data would have been nice during the Blanc brew.
